# Base — First 100 Buyers Tracker

Forget price.  
Forget volume.

The only thing that matters in the first 10 minutes of a Base memecoin  
is **who bought first**.

This script builds a live leaderboard of the **first 100 unique buyers** of every new token — in real time.

When it hits 100 buyers — it prints the top 5 earliest + biggest wallets.

## Run

```bash
python base_first_100_buyers.py
